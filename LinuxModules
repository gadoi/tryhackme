#Task 6 - awk

ippsec:34024
john:50024
thecybermentor:25923
liveoverflow:45345
nahamsec:12365
stok:1234

awk 'BEGIN{FS=" "; OFS=":"} {print $1,$4}' awk.txt


- How will you make the output as following (there can be multiple; answer it using the above specified variables in BEGIN pattern):
ippsec, john, thecybermentor, liveoverflow, nahamsec, stok, 
awk 'BEGIN{ORS=", "} {print $1}' awk.txt

#Task 7 - sed 
- How would you substitute every 3rd occurrence of the word 'hack' to 'back' on every line inside the file file.txt?
sed 's/hack/back/3g' file.txt

- How will you do the same operation only on 3rd and 4th line in file.txt?
sed '3,4 s/hack/back/3g' file.txt

- Download the given file, and try formatting the trailing spaces in sed1.txt with a colon(:).
sed 's/  */:/g' sed1.txt

- View the  sed2 file in the directory. Try putting all alphabetical values together, to get the answer for this question.
CONGRATULATIONS YOU MADE IT THROUGH THIS SMALL LITTLE CHALLENGE

- What pattern did you use to reach that answer string?
's/[[:digit:]]//g'


-Alternatively, you can use tr to remove all the digits, and then pipe the output in sed to remove trailing whitespaces.
cat sed2.txt | tr '[:digit:]' ' ' | sed 's/  *//g'

[Update] Another good way suggested by a room do-er. You can simply use tr -d command to delete all the digits from the file.
cat sed2.txt | tr -d '[:digit:]'

- What did she sed?(In double quotes)
"That's What"


# Task 8 - xargs
