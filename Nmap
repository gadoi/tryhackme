#Task 2 - Introduction
- What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?
ports
- How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?
65535
- [Research] How many of these are considered "well-known"? (These are the "standard" numbers mentioned in the task)
1024

#Task 3 -  Nmap Switches
- What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)?
-sS

- Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"?
-sU

- If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?
-O

- Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?
-sV

- The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?
-v

- Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?
(Note: it's highly advisable to always use at least this option)
-vv

- We should always save the output of our scans -- this means that we only need to run the scan once (reducing network traffic and thus chance of detection), and gives us a reference to use when writing reports for clients.
What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?
-oA

- What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format?
-oN

- A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format?
-oG

- Sometimes the results we're getting just aren't enough. If we don't care about how loud we are, we can enable "aggressive" mode. This is a shorthand switch that activates service detection, operating system detection, a traceroute and common script scanning.
How would you activate this setting?
-A

- Nmap offers five levels of "timing" template. These are essentially used to increase the speed your scan runs at. Be careful though: higher speeds are noisier, and can incur errors!
How would you set the timing template to level 5?
-T5

- We can also choose which port(s) to scan.
How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?
-p 80

- How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?
-p 1000-1500


- A very useful option that should not be ignored:
How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?
-p-

- How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)?
--script

- How would you activate all of the scripts in the "vuln" category?
--script=vuln
