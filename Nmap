#Task 2 - Introduction
- What networking constructs are used to direct traffic to the right application on a server?
ports
- How many of these are available on any network-enabled computer?
65535
- [Research] How many of these are considered "well-known"? (These are the "standard" numbers mentioned in the task)
1024

#Task 3 -  Nmap Switches
- What is the first switch listed in the help menu for a 'Syn Scan' (more on this later!)?
-sS

- Which switch would you use for a "UDP scan"?
-sU

- If you wanted to detect which operating system the target is running on, which switch would you use?
-O

- Nmap provides a switch to detect the version of the services running on the target. What is this switch?
-sV

- The default output provided by nmap often does not provide enough information for a pentester. How would you increase the verbosity?
-v

- Verbosity level one is good, but verbosity level two is better! How would you set the verbosity level to two?
(Note: it's highly advisable to always use at least this option)
-vv

- We should always save the output of our scans -- this means that we only need to run the scan once (reducing network traffic and thus chance of detection), and gives us a reference to use when writing reports for clients.
What switch would you use to save the nmap results in three major formats?
-oA

- What switch would you use to save the nmap results in a "normal" format?
-oN

- A very useful output format: how would you save results in a "grepable" format?
-oG

- Sometimes the results we're getting just aren't enough. If we don't care about how loud we are, we can enable "aggressive" mode. This is a shorthand switch that activates service detection, operating system detection, a traceroute and common script scanning.
How would you activate this setting?
-A

- Nmap offers five levels of "timing" template. These are essentially used to increase the speed your scan runs at. Be careful though: higher speeds are noisier, and can incur errors!
How would you set the timing template to level 5?
-T5

- We can also choose which port(s) to scan.
How would you tell nmap to only scan port 80?
-p 80

- How would you tell nmap to scan ports 1000-1500?
-p 1000-1500


- A very useful option that should not be ignored:
How would you tell nmap to scan all ports?
-p-

- How would you activate a script from the nmap scripting library (lots more on this later!)?
--script

- How would you activate all of the scripts in the "vuln" category?
--script=vuln

#Task 5 - Scan Types TCP Connect Scans 
- Which RFC defines the appropriate behaviour for the TCP protocol?
rfc 793

- If a port is closed, which flag should the server send back to indicate this?
rst

#Task 6 - Scan Types SYN Scans 
- There are two other names for a SYN scan, what are they?
Half-open, Stealth

- Can Nmap use a SYN scan without Sudo permissions (Y/N)?
N

#Task 7 - Scan Types UDP Scans 
- If a UDP port doesn't respond to an Nmap scan, what will it be marked as?
open|filtered

- When a UDP port is closed, by convention the target should send back a "port unreachable" message. Which protocol would it use to do so?
icmp

#Task 8 - Scan Types NULL, FIN and Xmas 
- Which of the three shown scan types uses the URG flag?
xmas

- Why are NULL, FIN and Xmas scans generally used?
firewall evasion

- Which common OS may respond to a NULL, FIN or Xmas scan with a RST for every port?
Microsoft Windows

#Task 9 - Scan Types ICMP Network Scanning 
- How would you perform a ping sweep on the 172.16.x.x network (Netmask: 255.255.0.0) using Nmap? (CIDR notation)
nmap -sn 172.16.0.0/16

#Task 10 - NSE Scripts Overview 
- What language are NSE scripts written in?
lua

- Which category of scripts would be a very bad idea to run in a production environment?
intrusive

#Task 11 - NSE Scripts Working with the NSE 
- What optional argument can the ftp-anon.nse script take?
maxlist

#Task 12 - NSE Scripts Searching for Scripts 
- Search for "smb" scripts in the /usr/share/nmap/scripts/ directory using either of the demonstrated methods.
What is the filename of the script which determines the underlying OS of the SMB server?
hint:ls -l /usr/share/nmap/scripts/*smb*
smb-os-discovery.nse

- Read through this script. What does it depend on?
hint: grep "depend" /usr/share/nmap/scripts/smb-os-discovery.nse
smb-brute

#Task 13 - Firewall Evasion

--data-length
